# Targets

Project targets in order of importance.

## Daily results in short sprints

My intention is to work on the task of the day for at most 2 hours a day, accepting any kind of result. 

### Progress

#### Monday 2018-07-09

Wrote down a lot of my ideas. Given that I had not decided ahead of time how to organize this, I think it went fine.

#### Tuesday 2018-07-10

My server is being updated as I couldn't install Docker on my main machine.


## Improving planning by doing a lot more of it

I think I could benefit from more planning and thus this project is focused on planning a lot more than normal.

### Progress

* Wrote a fair chunk of markdown in initial planning.
* Messed up planning for 10/7, should have realized my Windows version couldn't run Docker.


## Explore docker

I want to know if I can utilize Docker in some way to get a basic familiarity with Docker. I accept that it will be harmful to the chance of completion of the project.

### Progress


## Test-driven web-development in NodeJS

I like it in concept and I have made toys using this methodology. I want to make an actual application using it to explore further. But first I need a refresher.

### Progress


## The main application

Detailed in "design.md".

### Progress


## Explore Event Driven Architecture

Unsure if it is the correct terminology, but I like the idea of instead of storing state in the database I store the events that generate the state and thus state is found by applying all events. Unsure if I am able to incorporate this into the project.

### Progress

* This is skipped due to missing a day. I might do this after the main project.
