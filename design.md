# Core concept

The user MANAGER should be able to create an EVENT by answering or posing sets of QUESTIONS and then share the event to PARTICIPANTS. The manager may allow PARTICIPANTS to declare participation. The manager will be able to change details about the event and participants can chose to be notified. The manager can add message threads or polls to the questions to get participant input. Customizability for the manager and ease of use for the participant are of key importance.
