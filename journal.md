# Journal

A journal noting down a few of the decisions made.

# Week 28

### Agenda

Build a few toys with some unknown technologies in preparation of actually making the application in the following week.

## Monday 2018-07-09

### Agenda

Planning the project and setting up an initial development environment.

### Choices

* I will work on this project every workday week 28 and week 29 of summer 2018.
* Linux due to familiarity.
* Git to manage versioning.
* Markdown for documentation, mostly because I somewhat know it.
* Journal file to attempt to record my progress, hoping this will motivate me, while I am accepting that some days are bound to be pathetic. Because a fair chunk of this project will not be code I want this file in addition to git.
* Targets file to manage project goals as a target.
* Week 28 will be experimentation and toy building.
* The main application will be in NodeJS, with the main reason being I have some familiarity with it I want to improve and I want to try to write the front-end in some popular framework which should be easy to set up in node.
* Design document for the main application. Not sure how to structure it though.
